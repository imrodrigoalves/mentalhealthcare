# Mental Health Care (MHC)

MHC was a project developed to complete my high school graduation in 2018.
It's a "social network" type website targeted to a specific market.

Objectives:
- No use of CSS framework
- Creation of authentication system (Using Sessions)
- Database structure and normalization
- Use of AJAX requests

## Creator note

By sharing this I hope I can help others see that we all start somewhere and that we can improve after that.

I realize the amount of mistakes made in this and the amount of improvements it could get but again, this was my beginning and I'm for damn sure proud of what I did at the time with what I knew.
